There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent . Black 's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience . Christian Bay 's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires `` carefully chosen and legitimate means , '' but holds that they do not have to be non-violent . It has been argued that , while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects , rebellion is much more destructive ; therefore , the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience , and if one can not justify civil rebellion , then one can not justify a civil disobedients ' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest . Civil disobedients ' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society 's tolerance of civil disobedience .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 22], "label": true}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [22, 35], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [35, 64], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [64, 137], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [137, 156], "label": false}]}

Over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize power generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several US and European companies including two-phase and three-phase AC , high-voltage DC , and even compressed air . Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems . Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current . Based on Tesla 's advice and Westinghouse 's demonstration that they could build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition , a contract for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded to Westinghouse Electric . A further contract to build the AC distribution system was awarded to General Electric .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 41], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [41, 89], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [89, 104], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [104, 132], "label": true}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [132, 173], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [173, 188], "label": false}]}

Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7\u20130 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 68], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [68, 162], "label": true}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [162, 177], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [177, 195], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [195, 241], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [241, 306], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [306, 351], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [351, 383], "label": false}]}
