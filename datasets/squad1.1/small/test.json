Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC Working groups are held at the level of government representatives . Non Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers . Sessions of the IPCC Bureau , workshops , expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only . Attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts . After the opening ceremonies , closed plenary sessions were held .

Newton 's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . This law is an extension of Galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force ( see a more detailed description of this below ) . Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium `` natural state '' in place of the Aristotelian idea of the `` natural state of rest '' . That is , the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity . By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity , Newton 's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities . Specifically , in systems where objects are moving with different velocities , it is impossible to determine which object is `` in motion '' and which object is `` at rest '' . In other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a Galilean transformation .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 38], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [38, 69], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [69, 105], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [105, 131], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [131, 155], "label": true}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [155, 188], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [188, 224], "label": false}]}

Helper T cells express T cell receptors ( TCR ) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules . The MHC : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's CD4 co-receptor , which recruits molecules inside the T cell ( e.g. , Lck ) that are responsible for the T cell 's activation . Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC : antigen complex than observed for killer T cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200\u2013300 ) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC : antigen molecule . Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell . The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types . Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells . In addition , helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell 's surface , such as CD40 ligand ( also called CD154 ) , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [17, 37], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [37, 75], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [75, 140], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [140, 155], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [155, 177], "label": true}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [177, 198], "label": false}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [198, 241], "label": false}]}
