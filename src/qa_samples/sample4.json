{"question": "What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?", "context": "Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.", "answer": "Computational complexity theory"}
