Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.\", \"qas\": [{\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 0, \"text\": \"Inflammation\"}, {\"answer_start\": 0, \"text\": \"Inflammation\"}, {\"answer_start\": 0, \"text\": \"Inflammation\"}], \"question\": \"What is one of the first responses the immune system has to infection?\", \"id\": \"572900f73f37b31900477f69\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 166, \"text\": \"increased blood flow into tissue\"}, {\"answer_start\": 166, \"text\": \"increased blood flow into tissue\"}, {\"answer_start\": 166, \"text\": \"increased blood flow into tissue\"}], \"question\": \"What causes the symptoms of inflammation?\", \"id\": \"572900f73f37b31900477f6a\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 228, \"text\": \"eicosanoids and cytokines\"}, {\"answer_start\": 228, \"text\": \"eicosanoids and cytokines\"}, {\"answer_start\": 228, \"text\": \"eicosanoids\"}], \"question\": \"What compounds are released by injured or infected cells, triggering inflammation?\", \"id\": \"572900f73f37b31900477f6b\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 324, \"text\": \"prostaglandins\"}, {\"answer_start\": 324, \"text\": \"prostaglandins\"}, {\"answer_start\": 324, \"text\": \"prostaglandins\"}], \"question\": \"Eicosanoids include what compounds that result in fever and blood vessel dilation?\", \"id\": \"572900f73f37b31900477f6c\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 517, \"text\": \"interleukins\"}, {\"answer_start\": 517, \"text\": \"interleukins\"}, {\"answer_start\": 517, \"text\": \"interleukins\"}], \"question\": \"What cytokines are responsible for communication between white blood cells?\", \"id\": \"572900f73f37b31900477f6d\"}]}, {\"context\": \"Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles.

A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.\", \"qas\": [{\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 96, \"text\": \"immune surveillance\"}, {\"answer_start\": 96, \"text\": \"immune surveillance\"}, {\"answer_start\": 96, \"text\": \"immune surveillance\"}], \"question\": \"What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?\", \"id\": \"572a0f073f37b3190047867f\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 433, \"text\": \"human papillomavirus\"}, {\"answer_start\": 433, \"text\": \"human papillomavirus\"}, {\"answer_start\": 433, \"text\": \"human papillomavirus\"}], \"question\": \"What is the virus in humans that causes cervical cancer?\", \"id\": \"572a0f073f37b31900478680\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 641, \"text\": \"tyrosinase\"}, {\"answer_start\": 641, \"text\": \"tyrosinase\"}, {\"answer_start\": 641, \"text\": \"tyrosinase\"}], \"question\": \"What is an example of an enzyme that can transform skin cells into tumors when expressed at high levels?\", \"id\": \"572a0f073f37b31900478681\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 757, \"text\": \"melanomas\"}, {\"answer_start\": 757, \"text\": \"melanomas\"}, {\"answer_start\": 757, \"text\": \"melanomas\"}], \"question\": \"What are cancerous tumors of the skin known as?\", \"id\": \"572a0f073f37b31900478682\"}, {\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 725, \"text\": \"melanocytes\"}, {\"answer_start\": 725, \"text\": \"melanocytes\"}, {\"answer_start\": 725, \"text\": \"melanocytes\"}], \"question\": \"What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?\", \"id\": \"572a0f073f37b31900478683\"}]}, {\"context\": \"Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\\u20137 against the 4\\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible. For this, Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus, referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415.

This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>\", \"qas\": [{\"answers\": [{\"answer_start\": 34, \"text\": \"connection-oriented operations.
