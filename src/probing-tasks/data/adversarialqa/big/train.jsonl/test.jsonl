The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them , namely revenue from their personal lands , or demesne ; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord ; and revenue from taxation .  Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest .  Matters were not helped by Richard 's sale of many royal properties in 1189 , and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries .  English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income , including the scutage system , in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king .  He derived income from fines , court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges .  John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income , to the extent that he has been described as `` avaricious , miserly , extortionate and moneyminded '' .

Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972 .  He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus .  In Scandinavia , with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson , ruler of Norway , Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk .  As Prince of Kiev , Vladimir 's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus ' , a process that began in 988 .  The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship ( paganism ) of the Slavs , he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe .  They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite , the Jews , and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople .  They rejected Islam because , among other things , it prohibited the consumption of alcohol , and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country .  They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull .  But at Constantinople , they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow .  Upon their arrival home , they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all , upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna , the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [4, 19], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [19, 44], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [44, 74], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [74, 99], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [99, 144], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [144, 165], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [165, 201], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [201, 213], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [213, 254], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [254, 299], "label": "0"}]}

He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole , it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store .  Others , such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet , considered the interface to be `` clumsy and impractical '' due to its inconsistent design ( going as far as considering it `` two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together '' ) , and concluded that `` Windows 8 was n't born out of a need or demand ; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft 's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction\u2014touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against , and remain relevant in the face of Apple 's iPad .

As a result of the above features , the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area .  In contrast , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system .

On 29 November 1947 , the United Nations General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine .

The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948 .  That day , David Ben-Gurion , the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine , declared `` the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel , '' which would start to function from the termination of the mandate .  The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration .  Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces .

Symbols on the launch games ' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game , in order to reduce consumer confusion .

This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated .  Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional `` kef '' style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of `` kef music '' heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time .  Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia .  Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry .  Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan .

Since annelids are soft-bodied , their fossils are rare .  Polychaetes ' fossil record consists mainly of the jaws that some species had and the mineralized tubes that some secreted .  Some Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia in some ways resemble polychaetes , but the similarities are too vague for these fossils to be classified with confidence .  The small shelly fossil Cloudina , from 549 to 542 million years ago , has been classified by some authors as an annelid , but by others as a cnidarian ( i.e .  in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong ) .  Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta , both from Canada 's Burgess Shale , formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian .  Myoscolex , found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale , was possibly an annelid .  However , it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla .  Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet , about 518 million years old , and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date .  There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid .  Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician , about 488 to 474 million years ago .  It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found , thus the crown-group can not have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later .  By the end of the Carboniferous , about 299 million years ago , fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared .  Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic , less than 199 million years ago .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 22], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [22, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [43, 70], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [70, 103], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [103, 115], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [115, 149], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [149, 168], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [168, 196], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [196, 227], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [227, 246], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [246, 261], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [261, 292], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [292, 317], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [317, 349], "label": "0"}]}

In Homer 's Iliad , the names Danaans ( or Danaoi : \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af ) and Argives ( Argives : \u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9 ) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans .  The myth of Danaus , whose origin is Egypt , is a foundation legend of Argos .  His daughters Danaides , were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom .  This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled ( Sisyphos ) and the name can be derived from the PIE root * danu : `` river '' .  There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin .  Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen , one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III ( 1187-1156 BCE ) .  The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans .  The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia .  Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization .  These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim , the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash ( or Weshesh ) who may be Achaeans .  They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters .  Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da : - : `` flow , river '' , da : -nu : `` any moving liquid , drops '' , da : navo `` people living by the river , Skyth .  nomadic people ( in Rigveda water-demons , fem.Da : nu primordial goddess ) , in Greek Danaoi , Egypt .  Danuna '' .  It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek .

European comics studies began with T\u00f6pffer 's theories of his own work in the 1840s , which emphasized panel transitions and the visual\u2013verbal combination .  No further progress was made until the 1970s .  Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics , analyzing text\u2013image relations , page-level image relations , and image discontinuities , or what Scott McCloud later dubbed `` closure '' .  In 1987 , Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre , or `` multiframe '' , to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit .

Lysimachus , who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself , was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium , near Sardis .  Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus ' European territories in Thrace and Macedon , but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus ( `` the thunderbolt '' ) , who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon .  Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279 , his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy .  Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls .  He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 57], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [57, 86], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [86, 106], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [106, 157], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [157, 176], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [176, 216], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [216, 262], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [262, 287], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [287, 306], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [306, 323], "label": "0"}]}

In the paper `` Who 's Gay ?

He first suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction over behaviour and identity because it is less prone to self- and other-deception , social conditions and variable meanings .  To measure attraction and arousal he proposed that biological measures should be developed and used .  There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal , brain scans , eye tracking , body odour preference , and anatomical variations such as digit-length ratio and right or left handedness .  Secondly , Savin-Williams suggests that researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether and assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated .

In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius .  Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration .  One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo ( `` maiden '' in Latin ) due to Virgil 's excessive , `` maiden '' -like modesty .  Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( `` wand '' ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) .  In Norman schools ( following the French practice ) , the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings , hence Virgil .  In the 19th century , some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil , as it is closer to his original name , and is also the traditional German spelling .  [ citation needed ] Modern usage permits both , though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus .

Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents .  The instrument has also found its way into British rock music .  The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) .  It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose `` Fog on the Tyne '' was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 .  The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs .  Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No .  1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing .  It has also been used by other British rock musicians .  Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song .  Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman .  Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire .  McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example .  Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come .  One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band .  Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre .  The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr .  More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine .  British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs .  Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs .  The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse .  It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit `` Dance Tonight . ''  That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name .  The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people .

This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century , such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs , Richard von Krafft-Ebing , Magnus Hirschfeld , Havelock Ellis , Carl Jung , and Sigmund Freud , as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves .  However , this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time , and , through the second half of the twentieth century , gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation .  Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men , women , or both , although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations .  An individual homosexual , heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine , feminine , or androgynous , and in addition , many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the `` gender-conforming heterosexual '' and the `` gender-nonconforming homosexual '' as negative stereotypes .

The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world .  Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music .  In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called `` kef '' style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular .  This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated .  Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional `` kef '' style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of `` kef music '' heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time .  Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia .  Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry .  Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan .  Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher .  Ruben Hakobyan ( Ruben Sasuntsi ) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent .  In the Armenian diaspora , Armenian revolutionary songs are popular with the youth .  [ citation needed ] These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 28], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [28, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [43, 82], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [82, 116], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [116, 165], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [165, 216], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [216, 237], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [237, 279], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [279, 315], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [315, 349], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [349, 363], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [363, 382], "label": "0"}]}

Critics of antihumanism , most notably J\u00fcrgen Habermas , counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism 's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal , they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own .  Others , like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks , but thought humanism applied only to the German `` race '' and specifically to the Nazis and thus , in Davies ' words , were anti-humanist humanists .  Such a reading of Heidegger 's thought is itself deeply controversial ; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism .  Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century `` it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man ' or the 'triumph of human reason ' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them '' .  For `` it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason '' .  Yet , he continues , `` it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms .  For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution .  The freedom to speak and write , to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests , to protest and disobey : all these can only be articulated in humanist terms .

In 1824 , the French physicist Fran\u00e7ois Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields , termed Arago 's rotations , which , by manually turning switches on and off , Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor .  In the 1880s , many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC 's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC .  The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla , a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887 .  In 1888 , the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris ' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that `` the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor . ''  In 1888 , Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types : one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor , another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor , and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding .  One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887 , however , also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor .  George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla 's patents , employed Tesla to develop them , and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla , Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889 .  The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride , Colorado in 1891 .  Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development , Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890 .  This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications .  However , he claimed that Tesla 's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations , which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work .  Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893 , these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor .  The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891 .  By 1896 , General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design , later called the squirrel-cage rotor .  Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower ( HP ) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897 .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 52], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [52, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [84, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [119, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [161, 227], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [227, 245], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [245, 276], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [276, 309], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [309, 334], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [334, 349], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [349, 375], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [375, 419], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [419, 431], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [431, 453], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [453, 487], "label": "0"}]}

The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi , ( as opposed to being so named by others ) and , at least those educated , considered their ethnicity ( genos ) to be Hellenic .

These Greeks either emigrated , particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector , the Russian Empire , or simply converted to Islam , often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian .

Many modern specialty matches have been devised , with unique winning conditions .  The most common of these is the ladder match .  In the basic ladder match , the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring .  The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team .  As a result , the ladder can be used as a weapon .  The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt ( the traditional prize ) , a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot , or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match ( such as one granting the winner a cash prize ) .  Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal .  In a battle royal , all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time .  When the match begins , the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent .  The last wrestler standing is declared the winner .  A variant on this type of match is the WWE 's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals ( previously 2 minutes ) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring .

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19 , and the division lead grew to 8 1\u20442 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1\u20442 games over the New York Mets .  After the game of September 2 , the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55 .  But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning .  The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati , then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates ( who would finish in third place ) .  After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4 , the Cubs led going into the ninth inning .  A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day .  But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out , 2-strike pitch from the Cubs ' ace reliever , Phil Regan , onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth .  The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings .  Burdened by a four-game losing streak , the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set .  The Mets won both games , and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1\u20442 game in front .  Disaster followed in Philadelphia , as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice , to extend Chicago 's losing streak to eight games .  In a key play in the second game , on September 11 , Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo , who was nowhere near the bag or the ball .  Selma 's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally .  After that second Philly loss , the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57 .  The Mets would not look back .

Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length , however , results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great , and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna 's net performance .  Thus rather thick tubes are typically used for the solid elements of such antennas , including Yagi-Uda arrays .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 31], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [31, 70], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [70, 110], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [110, 158], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [158, 177], "label": "0"}]}

The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee 's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it ; although this claim has been widely disputed .  Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird .

''  This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe , who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee 's attorney and found them to be only another draft of `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' .

Playing into this , some wrestlers will `` milk '' the count by sliding in the ring , and immediately sliding back out .  As they were technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again , it is sufficient to restart the count .  This is often referred to by commentators as `` breaking the count .

In the basic ladder match , the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring .  The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team .  As a result , the ladder can be used as a weapon .  The prizes include \u2013 but are not limited to any given championship belt ( the traditional prize ) , a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot , or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match ( such as one granting the winner a cash prize ) .  Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal .  In a battle royal , all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time .  When the match begins , the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor in order to eliminate that opponent .  The last wrestler standing is declared the winner .  A variant on this type of match is the WWE 's Royal Rumble where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals ( previously 2 minutes ) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring .

Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents .  The instrument has also found its way into British rock music .  The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) .  It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose `` Fog on the Tyne '' was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 .  The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs .  Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No .  1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing .  It has also been used by other British rock musicians .  Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song .  Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman .  Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire .  McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example .  Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come .  One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band .  Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre .  The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr .  More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine .  British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs .  Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs .  The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse .  It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit `` Dance Tonight . ''  That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name .  The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people .  Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin .  This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones .

In addition to having evolved , for the most part , separately from one another and with distinct individual histories , the Latin-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true `` dialects '' due to the often high degree in which they lack mutual intelligibility .  Though mostly mutually unintelligible , the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies , often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages , with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible .  For instance , a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard , a language in Northern Italy 's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect , would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant .  Due to Eastern Lombard 's status as a Gallo-Italic language , an Eastern Lombard speaker may , in fact , have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan , Catalan , or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker .

Vascular land plants make lignin , a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress .  Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood .  Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record .  It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period .  The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods .  Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway .  These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [6, 32], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [32, 68], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [68, 94], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [94, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [133, 152], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [152, 179], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [179, 225], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [225, 234], "label": "0"}]}

Regarding the timing of German rapprochement , many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov , whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany , removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany .  Stalin immediately directed Molotov to `` purge the ministry of Jews . ''  Given Litvinov 's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition , association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain , and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin , his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany .  [ f ] Likewise , Molotov 's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers .  The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany .  One British official wrote that Litvinov 's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber , while Molotov 's `` modus operandi '' was `` more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan . ''  Carr argued that the Soviet Union 's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3 , 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany , but rather was Stalin 's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man , namely Molotov , to the Foreign Commissariat .  Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations , but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks .  Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany .  Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov 's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks , because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [43, 56], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [56, 103], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [103, 125], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [125, 143], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [143, 180], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [180, 241], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [241, 268], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [268, 299], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [299, 323], "label": "0"}]}

Homer uses the terms Achaeans and Danaans ( \u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bf\u03af ) as a generic term for Greeks in Iliad , and they were probably a part of the Mycenean civilization .  The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown .  They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion .  In the 5th century BC , they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly , Boeotia and Lesbos .  There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans .  According to one view , the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe , who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age ( 1300 BC ) to southern Europe .  Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans .  These theories are rejected by other scholars who , based on linguistic criteria , suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks .  There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC .  Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya .  Egyptian documents refer to Ekwesh , one of the groups of sea peoples who attached Egypt during the reign of Merneptah ( 1213-1203 BCE ) , who may have been Achaeans .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [11, 41], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [41, 58], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [58, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [75, 101], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [101, 113], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [113, 149], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [149, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [160, 183], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [183, 207], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [207, 222], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [222, 254], "label": "0"}]}

Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight .  About 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds .

By around the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty , this Han cursive became known as \u7ae0\u8349 zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo ( also known as \u96b6\u8349 / \u96b8\u8349 l\u00ecc\u01ceo today ) , or in English sometimes clerical cursive , ancient cursive , or draft cursive .  Some believe that the name , based on \u7ae0 zh\u0101ng meaning `` orderly '' , arose because the script was a more orderly form of cursive than the modern form , which emerged during the Eastern Jin dynasty and is still in use today , called \u4eca\u8349 j\u012bnc\u01ceo or `` modern cursive '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [16, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [43, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [119, 162], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [162, 216], "label": "0"}]}

Some street trams ( streetcars ) used conduit third-rail current collection .  The third rail was below street level .  The tram picked up the current through a plough ( U.S. `` plow '' ) accessed through a narrow slot in the road .  In the United States , much ( though not all ) of the former streetcar system in Washington , D.C. ( discontinued in 1962 ) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction .  The same was true with Manhattan 's former streetcar system .

The slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams/cars ( in some cases , the conduit slot was originally a cable slot ) .  The disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher initial installation costs , higher maintenance costs , and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot .  For this reason , in Washington , D.C. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center , a worker in a `` plough pit '' disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole ( hitherto hooked down to the roof ) to the overhead wire .  In New York City for the same reasons of cost and operating efficiency outside of Manhattan overhead wire was used .  A similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the London tramways , notably on the southern side ; a typical changeover point was at Norwood , where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails , to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [31, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [43, 51], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [51, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [75, 117], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [117, 128], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [128, 201], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [201, 230], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [230, 257], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [257, 309], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [309, 330], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 31], "span2": [330, 383], "label": "0"}]}

Notre Dame 's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment , and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014 .  The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East ; while they maintain their football independence , they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents .  In ice hockey , the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference 's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school 's former hockey home , the Central Collegiate Hockey Association , after the 2012\u201313 season .  Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East .  After Notre Dame joined the ACC , the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year .  There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns .  The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams .  In addition , the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname .  The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams .  Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964 , the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers .  The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 44], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [44, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [84, 142], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [142, 152], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [152, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [177, 224], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [224, 246], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [246, 262], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [262, 274], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [274, 300], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [300, 317], "label": "0"}]}

Interestingly , Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus , the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion .  Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions .  He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience .  Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process : general physiological arousal , and experience of emotion .  For example , the physiological arousal , heart pounding , in a response to an evoking stimulus , the sight of a bear in the kitchen .  The brain then quickly scans the area , to explain the pounding , and notices the bear .  Consequently , the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear .  With his student , Jerome Singer , Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine .  Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation ( a confederate ) displayed that emotion .  Hence , the combination of the appraisal of the situation ( cognitive ) and the participants ' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response .

Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era ( 1865-1877 ) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living .  In 1865 , General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the `` Forty acres and a mule '' policy .  The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition .  Nearly a century later ( 1950s-1960s ) , policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement .  The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment .  The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory , as well as voluntary programs , affirmed the civil rights of people of color .  Furthermore , these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination .  In 1961 , President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term `` affirmative action '' in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors `` take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed , and employees are treated during employment , without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin . ''  This executive order realized the government 's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people .  This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B.

A twelfth nation , the Little Shell Chippewa is a `` landless '' people headquartered in Great Falls , recognized by the state of Montana but not by the U.S. Government .  The Blackfeet nation is headquartered on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation ( 1851 ) in Browning , Crow on the Crow Indian Reservation ( 1851 ) in Crow Agency , Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Pend d'Oreille on the Flathead Indian Reservation ( 1855 ) in Pablo , Northern Cheyenne on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation ( 1884 ) at Lame Deer , Assiniboine and Gros Ventre on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation ( 1888 ) in Fort Belknap Agency , Assiniboine and Sioux on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation ( 1888 ) at Poplar , and Chippewa-Cree on the Rocky Boy 's Indian Reservation ( 1916 ) near Box Elder .  Approximately 63 % of all Native people live off the reservations , concentrated in the larger Montana cities with the largest concentration of urban Indians in Great Falls .

Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician , Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n , who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt .  Interestingly , Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus , the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion .  Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions .  He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience .  Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process : general physiological arousal , and experience of emotion .  For example , the physiological arousal , heart pounding , in a response to an evoking stimulus , the sight of a bear in the kitchen .  The brain then quickly scans the area , to explain the pounding , and notices the bear .  Consequently , the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear .  With his student , Jerome Singer , Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine .  Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation ( a confederate ) displayed that emotion .  Hence , the combination of the appraisal of the situation ( cognitive ) and the participants ' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response .

The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world .  Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music .  In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States , the so-called `` kef '' style Armenian dance music , using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments ( often electrified/amplified ) and some western instruments , was popular .  This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia , and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated .  Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional `` kef '' style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of `` kef music '' heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time .  Later , stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European ( especially French ) pop music , the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia .  Also with artists such as Sirusho , performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today 's entertainment industry .  Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour , pianist Sahan Arzruni , prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan .  Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down ( which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs ) or pop star Cher .

European comics studies began with T\u00f6pffer 's theories of his own work in the 1840s , which emphasized panel transitions and the visual\u2013verbal combination .

Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics , analyzing text\u2013image relations , page-level image relations , and image discontinuities , or what Scott McCloud later dubbed `` closure '' .  In 1987 , Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre , or `` multiframe '' , to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit .  By the 1990s , theorists such as Beno\u00eet Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists ' po\u00efetic creative choices .  Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics , a medium that has taken various , equally valid forms over its history .  Morgan sees comics as a subset of `` les litt\u00e9ratures dessin\u00e9es '' ( or `` drawn literatures '' ) .

Since the mid-2000s , Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science , extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments .

By 1959 , American observers believed that the Soviet Union would be the first to get a human into space , because of the time needed to prepare for Mercury 's first launch .  On April 12 , 1961 , the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1 .  They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut , roughly translated from Russian and Greek as `` sailor of the universe '' .  Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer , it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution ; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space .  Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union , with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters ( 23,000 ft ) , and landing by parachute .  The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale ( International Federation of Aeronautics ) credited Gagarin with the world 's first human space flight , although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft .  For this reason , the Soviet Union omitted from their FAI submission the fact that Gagarin did not land with his capsule .  When the FAI filing for Gherman Titov 's second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique , the FAI committee decided to investigate , and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch , orbiting , and return , rather than the manner of landing , and so revised their rules accordingly , keeping Gagarin 's and Titov 's records intact .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [14, 48], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [48, 79], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [79, 100], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [100, 168], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [168, 204], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [204, 246], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [246, 269], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [269, 339], "label": "0"}]}

But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength , reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases .  With shorter wavelengths ( higher frequencies ) , this is generally the case .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [6, 21], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [21, 64], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [64, 88], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [88, 102], "label": "0"}]}

By 1959 , American observers believed that the Soviet Union would be the first to get a human into space , because of the time needed to prepare for Mercury 's first launch .  On April 12 , 1961 , the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1 .  They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut , roughly translated from Russian and Greek as `` sailor of the universe '' .  Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer , it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution ; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space .  Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union , with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters ( 23,000 ft ) , and landing by parachute .  The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale ( International Federation of Aeronautics ) credited Gagarin with the world 's first human space flight , although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft .  For this reason , the Soviet Union omitted from their FAI submission the fact that Gagarin did not land with his capsule .  When the FAI filing for Gherman Titov 's second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique , the FAI committee decided to investigate , and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch , orbiting , and return , rather than the manner of landing , and so revised their rules accordingly , keeping Gagarin 's and Titov 's records intact .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [6, 40], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [40, 71], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [71, 92], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [92, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [160, 196], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [196, 238], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [238, 261], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [261, 331], "label": "0"}]}

After running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango , General Agust\u00edn Enrique Brincourt made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua .  On July 8 , 1865 Brincourt crossed the Nazas River in northern Durango , heading toward Chihuahua .  On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of R\u00edo Florido into Ciudad Jim\u00e9nez ; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral .  Brincourt continued through Santa Rosalia de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales .  President Ju\u00e1rez remained in the state capital until August 5 , 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte ( present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez ) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city .  On the same day , the President named General Manuel Ojinaga the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces .  Meanwhile , General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral ; after a short two-hour battle , Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat .  At the Battle of Parral , the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces .  On August 13 , 1865 , the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City , and on August 15 , 1865 , General Brincourt defeated the republican forces , taking control of the state capital .  Brincourt designated Tom\u00e1s Zuloaga as Prefect of Chihuahua .  Fearing the French would continue their campaign to El Paso del Norte , President Ju\u00e1rez relocated to El Carrizal , a secluded place in the mountains near El Paso del Norte , in August 1865 , .  It would have been easy for the French forces to continue in pursuit of President Ju\u00e1rez across the border , but they feared altercations with American forces .  General Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City .  General Brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state , but his request was denied .  After the death of General Ojinaga , the Republican government declared General Villagran in charge of the fight against the Imperial forces .  The French left the state on October 29 , 1865 .  President Ju\u00e1rez returned to Chihuahua City on November 20 , 1865 and remained in the city until December 9 , 1865 when he returned to El Paso del Norte .

Merrem , Special Representative to the Secretary General , a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative .  The ceasefire guaranteed 30 % of ministerial positions would go to the opposition .  Elections were held in 1999 , though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98 % of the vote .  Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon ( with 79 % of the vote ) and he began his third term in office .  Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) criticized it , although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent .  Rahmon 's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media .  The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 37], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [37, 65], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [65, 91], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [91, 113], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [113, 120], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [120, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [133, 173], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [173, 187], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [187, 216], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [216, 241], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [241, 279], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [279, 301], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [301, 336], "label": "0"}]}

Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega , which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988 .  Nintendo 's intention , however , was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself .  Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges , and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced .  Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo , so publishers assumed all the risk .  As a result , some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games .  Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges , it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers , which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system , order at least 10,000 cartridges , and only make five games per year .  A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25 % of publishers ' requests for cartridges .  This was an average figure , with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none .  GameSpy noted that Nintendo 's `` iron-clad terms '' made the company many enemies during the 1980s .  Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami 's Ultra Games label ; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 28], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [28, 47], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [47, 77], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [77, 92], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [92, 127], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [127, 183], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [183, 207], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [207, 225], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [225, 243], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [243, 271], "label": "0"}]}

The major philosophies during the period , Confucianism , Legalism , Mohism , Agrarianism and Taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools .  Philosophers such as Confucius , Mencius , and Mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies .  Confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships .  Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws .  Mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism .  The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism .  Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism .

The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque , who resisted total abstraction .  Other Cubists , by contrast , especially Franti\u0161ek Kupka , and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire ( Delaunay , L\u00e9ger , Picabia and Duchamp ) , accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely .  Kupka \u2019 s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne , Amorpha-Fugue \u00e0 deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude , were highly abstract ( or nonrepresentational ) and metaphysical in orientation .  Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes .  Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows , followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires , in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues ; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete .  In 1913\u201314 L\u00e9ger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms , giving a similar stress to color , line and form .  His Cubism , despite its abstract qualities , was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life .  Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes ( 1913 ) , writing of a new `` pure '' painting in which the subject was vacated .

In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case , however , the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state 's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment .  The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death , but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out .  Therefore , the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit .  Yet , as Clarence Hill 's own case shows , lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay .

Mill 's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience .  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill 's position center around the following issues : Firstly , Mill 's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations .  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such `` groups of permanent possibilities of sensation '' might exist in the first place .  Berkeley put God in that gap ; the phenomenalists , including Mill , essentially left the question unanswered .  In the end , lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of `` reality '' that goes beyond mere `` possibilities of sensation '' , such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism .  Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved , how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands , etc. , remain unanswered , and perhaps unanswerable in these terms .  Secondly , Mill 's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the `` gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all '' .  Thirdly , Mill 's position , by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference , misapprehends mathematics .  It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science , the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not , either today or at the time Mill wrote , fall under the agreed meaning of induction .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 30], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [30, 69], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [69, 94], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [94, 113], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [113, 148], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [148, 186], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [186, 211], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [211, 230], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [230, 279], "label": "1"}]}

Like the reptiles , birds are primarily uricotelic , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine .  Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and ( with exception of the ostrich ) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste .  However , birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic , excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia .  They also excrete creatine , rather than creatinine like mammals .  This material , as well as the output of the intestines , emerges from the bird 's cloaca .  The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cloaca , and females lay eggs from it .  In addition , many species of birds regurgitate pellets .  Males within Palaeognathae ( with the exception of the kiwis ) , the Anseriformes ( with the exception of screamers ) , and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes ( but fully developed in Cracidae ) possess a penis , which is never present in Neoaves .  The length is thought to be related to sperm competition .  When not copulating , it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca , just inside the vent .

Mammalian hair , also known as pelage , can vary in color between populations , organisms within a population , and even on the individual organism .  Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa .  Sometimes , this color variation is determined by age variation , however , in other cases , it is determined by other factors .  Selective pressures , such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions , often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration .  These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival .  Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals , although there is also evidence that sexual selection , communication , and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well .  Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation , as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey .  Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators , indicating health for reproductive purposes , communicating between mother and young , and intimidating predators .  Studies have shown that in some cases , differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels , which are important in the mate selection process .  One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes , such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments .  Although much has been observed about color variation , much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown .  The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by : 1 ) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs , and 2 ) altering the density and distribution of the hairs .  Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation .

A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere .  Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city ; `` bistro '' means `` quickly '' in Russian , and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment .  Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris , due to rising costs , competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants , and different eating habits of Parisian diners .  A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery , which served beer and food at any hour .  Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867 ; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage , particular German costumes for beer .

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment , including Deism and talk of atheism .  Deism , according to Thomas Paine , is the simple belief in God the Creator , with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source .  Instead , the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time .  Atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents .  Wilson and Reill note that , `` In fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of Christianity , were true atheists .  Rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . ''  Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men .  Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined .  That is , since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society .  Bayle ( 1647\u20131706 ) observed that in his day , `` prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] . `` .  He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society .  Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law , the result would be moral anarchy : every individual `` could have no law but his own will , no end but himself .  He would be a god to himself , and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [17, 36], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [36, 64], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [64, 89], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [89, 100], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [100, 128], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [128, 151], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [151, 165], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [165, 188], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [188, 220], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [220, 245], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [245, 268], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [268, 305], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [305, 331], "label": "0"}]}

A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels ( e.g. , anger , pride , fear , happiness ) , physiological changes ( e.g. , increased perspiration , changes in pulse rate ) , expressive facial and body movements ( e.g. , smiling , frowning , baring teeth ) , and appraisals of situational cues .  One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner ( 2007 : 2009 ) .  Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions .  When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold , they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self , other and situation are met or not met .  People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals .  Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology , psychology , evolutionary science , and neuroscience .  Based on this analysis , he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger , aversion-fear , satisfaction-happiness , and disappointment-sadness .  These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences .  These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner 's theory and they include sentiments such as pride , triumph , and awe .  Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [6, 76], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [76, 96], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [96, 116], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [116, 157], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [157, 179], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [179, 203], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [203, 231], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [231, 260], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [260, 285], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 6], "span2": [285, 317], "label": "0"}]}

It had already been damaged , two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out .  Its pilot , Feldwebel Robert Zehbe , landed , only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack .  During the Dornier 's descent , it somehow unloaded its bombs , one of which hit the Palace .  It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station .  The bomber 's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London .  The British pilot became a King 's Messenger after the war , and died at the age of 90 in 2005 .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 30], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [30, 46], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [46, 61], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [61, 65], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [65, 69], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [69, 79], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [79, 98], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [98, 118], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [118, 137], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [137, 148], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [148, 163], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [163, 185], "label": "0"}]}
