Following the American Revolutionary War , the United States faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier . The United States was a minor military power during this time , having only a modest army , Marine corps , and navy . A traditional distrust of standing armies , combined with faith in the abilities of local militia , precluded the development of well - trained units and a professional officer corps . Jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy , fearing that a large military establishment would involve the United States in excessive foreign wars , and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 35], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [35, 59], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [59, 90], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [90, 125], "label": "0"}]}

Videophone calls ( also : videocalls , video chat as well as Skype and Skyping in verb form ), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals , not groups . However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call . In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point - to - point calls between two units . Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [14, 47], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [47, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [75, 100], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [100, 116], "label": "0"}]}
