During World War I , the palace , then the home of King George V and Queen Mary , escaped unscathed . Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ . The King imposed rationing at the palace , much to the dismay of his guests and household . To the King 's later regret , David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol , to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class . The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence . In 1938 , the north-west pavilion , designed by Nash as a conservatory , was converted into a swimming pool .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 31], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [31, 47], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [47, 65], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [65, 103], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [103, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [119, 140], "label": "0"}]}

In The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism , Popper developed a critique of historicism and a defence of the `` Open Society '' .

He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of authoritarianism and totalitarianism . He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction . Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history , and since `` no society can predict , scientifically , its own future states of knowledge '' , it follows , he argued , that there can be no predictive science of human history .
