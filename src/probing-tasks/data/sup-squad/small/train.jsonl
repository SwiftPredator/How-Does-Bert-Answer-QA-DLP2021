The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest .

The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10\u22126 torr ( 0.1 mPa ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology .

From 2004 to 2007 , the top five U.S. investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage ( see diagram ) , which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock . Changes in capital requirements , intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts , allowed lower risk weightings for AAA securities . The shift from first-loss tranches to AAA tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage . These five institutions reported over $ 4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007 , about 30 % of USA nominal GDP for 2007 . Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated , Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices , and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks , subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation . With the exception of Lehman , these companies required or received government support . Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company 's possible sale .
