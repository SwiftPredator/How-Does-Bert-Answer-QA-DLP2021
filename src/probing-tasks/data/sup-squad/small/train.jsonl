The key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current . This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents , intended to be carried by the earthed ( grounded ) running rail , flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead . This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together . The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains . Some of these , particularly Victorian mains that predated London 's underground railways , were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments . The four-rail system solves the problem . Although the supply has an artificially created earth point , this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels . Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak , but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains . However , elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 25], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [25, 58], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [58, 76], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [76, 101], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [101, 131], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [131, 138], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [138, 167], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [167, 206], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [206, 243], "label": "0"}]}

Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom , the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties\u2014 with about one third killed\u2014 would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London . The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced , from 75 in 1922 , to 150 in 1934 , to 644 in 1937 .

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment , including Deism and talk of atheism . Deism , according to Thomas Paine , is the simple belief in God the Creator , with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source . Instead , the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time . Atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents . Wilson and Reill note that , `` In fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of Christianity , were true atheists . Rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . '' Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men . Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined . That is , since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society . Bayle ( 1647\u20131706 ) observed that in his day , `` prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] . `` . He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society . Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law , the result would be moral anarchy : every individual `` could have no law but his own will , no end but himself . He would be a god to himself , and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 31], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [31, 59], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [59, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [84, 95], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [95, 123], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [123, 146], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [146, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [160, 183], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [183, 215], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [215, 240], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [240, 263], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [263, 300], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [300, 326], "label": "0"}]}

In this view , phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another ; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific . Rather than acting on segments , phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups . Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance . Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously ( though the output of one process may be the input to another ) . The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan ( Stampe 's wife ) ; there are many natural phonologists in Europe , and a few in the U.S. , such as Geoffrey Nathan .

Unlike the still-popular Vestiges , it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation , though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression . Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science , and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments . David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience , but noted that Darwin 's literary style was uneven : in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read , while in other places his writing was beautiful . Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics , and recommended the first edition . James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace 's essay , it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on , which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail . He added that some parts of Origin are dense , but other parts are almost lyrical , and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books , which broadened its audience .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [29, 62], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [62, 90], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [90, 116], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [116, 164], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [164, 189], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [189, 241], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 29], "span2": [241, 281], "label": "0"}]}
