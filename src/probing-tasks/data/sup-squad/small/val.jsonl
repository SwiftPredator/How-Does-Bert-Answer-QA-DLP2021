Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral . Bath stone is also widely used . Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century , as did Hans Price in the 19th century , but it was used long before then . It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel , at locations in Wiltshire such as Box . Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today , but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material . Further south , Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill , which is also widely used in the construction industry . Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement . Until the 1960s , Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries , as did several other Polden villages . Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball , adjacent to the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . Its derelict , early 20th century remains , was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s . Since the 1920s , the county has supplied aggregates .
