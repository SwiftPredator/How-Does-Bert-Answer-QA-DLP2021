The debate on a new delimitation of the German territory started in 1919 as part of discussions about the new constitution . Hugo Preuss , the father of the Weimar Constitution , drafted a plan to divide the German Reich into 14 roughly equal - sized states . His proposal was turned down due to opposition of the states and concerns of the government . Article 18 of the constitution enabled a new delimitation of the German territory but set high hurdles : Three fifth of the votes handed in , and at least the majority of the population are necessary to decide on the alteration of territory . In fact , until 1933 there were only four changes in the configuration of the German states : The 7 Thuringian states were merged in 1920 , whereby Coburg opted for Bavaria , Pyrmont joined Prussia in 1922 , and Waldeck did so in 1929 . Any later plans to break up the dominating Prussia into smaller states failed because political circumstances were not favorable to state reforms .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 32], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [32, 58], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [58, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [75, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [119, 165], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [165, 188], "label": "0"}]}
