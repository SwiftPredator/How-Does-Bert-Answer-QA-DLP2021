The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest .

The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10\u22126 torr ( 0.1 mPa ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology .

Changes in capital requirements , intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts , allowed lower risk weightings for AAA securities . The shift from first-loss tranches to AAA tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage . These five institutions reported over $ 4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007 , about 30 % of USA nominal GDP for 2007 . Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated , Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices , and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks , subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation . With the exception of Lehman , these companies required or received government support . Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company 's possible sale .

His book Evolution and Dogma ( 1896 ) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true , and argued , moreover , that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it . The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm 's censure by the Vatican . In 1913 , Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [18, 24], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [24, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [42, 68], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [68, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [105, 124], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [124, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [161, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [177, 195], "label": "0"}]}

Controversy persists over whether the Rus \u2019 were Varangians ( Vikings ) or Slavs . This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources .

To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region . According to the `` Normanist '' view , the Rus ' were Scandinavians , while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus ' were themselves Slavs . Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs , the Russian Primary Chronicle , although even this account was not produced until the 12th century . Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus ' were present before the arrival of the Varangians , noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names . Nevertheless , archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest . On balance , it seems likely that the Rus ' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class , while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs .

In the nineteenth century Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives . Burke 's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke `` was a man who truly & prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles '' but because Burke wrote with so much passion , people were doubtful of his arguments . William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had , when he had separated from Fox , and an observer said Windham spoke `` like the ghost of Burke '' when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801 . William Hazlitt , a political opponent of Burke , regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers ( the others being Junius and Rousseau ) , and made it `` a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party , whether he allowed Burke to be a great man '' . William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in ' A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff ' ( 1793 ) , but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke . In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland Wordsworth called Burke `` the most sagacious Politician of his age '' whose predictions `` time has verified '' . He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke ( `` Genius of Burke ! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders '' ) and portrayed him as an old oak . Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion : he had criticised Burke in The Watchman , but in his Friend ( 1809\u201310 ) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency . Later , in his Biographia Literaria ( 1817 ) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring `` habitually to principles . He was a scientific statesman ; and therefore a seer '' . Henry Brougham wrote of Burke : `` ... all his predictions , save one momentary expression , had been more than fulfilled : anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France ; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe ... the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity '' . George Canning believed that Burke 's Reflections `` has been justified by the course of subsequent events ; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled '' . In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke 's `` last works and words [ as ] the manual of my politics '' . The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli `` was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke 's later writings '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 25], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [25, 72], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [72, 120], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [120, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [177, 221], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [221, 250], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [250, 268], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [268, 284], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [284, 317], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [317, 342], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [342, 354], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [354, 411], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [411, 439], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [439, 463], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [463, 485], "label": "0"}]}

Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills . Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy , sharing , and leadership . Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves . By utilizing these relationships , adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming . Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent \u2019 s own self-concept . Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers , as well as self-opinions and values , an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment . Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual , such as on academic motivation and performance . However , while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it . Peers can have negative influences , such as encouraging experimentation with drugs , drinking , vandalism , and stealing through peer pressure . Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence , peaks around age 14 , and declines thereafter . Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers , where emotional ( rather than solution-based ) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers . Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties , especially depression , as is social rejection .

The body \u2019 s capability to react to antigen depends on a person 's age , antigen type , maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented . Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency , because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed . Once born , a child \u2019 s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides . In fact , many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas . In neonates , opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited . For example , the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65 % of that found in the adult . Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns . This is due to lower opsonic activity , as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors , which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium . Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production , which also limits the newborn 's phagocytic activity . Although , the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults , the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired . Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells . Also , T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-12 , and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage .

Seventy-two healthy female and male university students , randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group , were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards \u2013 a computerized version of the card game `` Concentration '' or `` Memory '' . The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla , as odour is a strong cue for memory . Retention testing took place the following day , either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present , or in a different room without the fragrance . The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent ( an incongruent context ) ; however , the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent ( a congruent context ) . All participants in the experiment , both stressed and unstressed , performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 33], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [33, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [84, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [133, 158], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [158, 187], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [187, 248], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [248, 270], "label": "0"}]}

Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation , the taliqa , was reserved for the ruler 's court , not the madrasa , and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound . The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain , the only likely point of transmission , after the establishment of the first medieval universities . In fact , there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and , most importantly , no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation , something they would have certainly found noteworthy . Rather , it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion . Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having `` common problems : to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities , and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy '' ; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence , not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other , a view shared by Hugh Kennedy .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [16, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [43, 90], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [90, 134], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [134, 157], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [157, 199], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [199, 220], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 16], "span2": [220, 299], "label": "0"}]}

In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC , attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe , discovered in Vasht\u00ebmi , southeastern Albania and dating back to 6,500 BC . Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC , and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC ( La Hoguette ) . Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly , which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star\u010devo-K\u00f6r\u00f6s ( Cris ) , Linearbandkeramik , and Vin\u010da . Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples , the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC . The Vin\u010da culture may have created the earliest system of writing , the Vin\u010da signs , though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing . The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania , Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC . The megalithic temple complexes of \u0120gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo ( in the Maltese archipelago ) and of Mnajdra ( Malta ) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures , the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC . The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni , Paola , Malta , is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC ; originally a sanctuary , it became a necropolis , the only prehistoric underground temple in the world , and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands . After 2500 BC , the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants , a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta . In most cases there are small chambers here , with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones . They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples . It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [15, 52], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [52, 77], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [77, 111], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [111, 138], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [138, 175], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [175, 193], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [193, 236], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [236, 289], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [289, 329], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [329, 351], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [351, 370], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [370, 399], "label": "0"}]}

The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells : neurons and glial cells . Glial cells ( also known as glia or neuroglia ) come in several types , and perform a number of critical functions , including structural support , metabolic support , insulation , and guidance of development . Neurons , however , are usually considered the most important cells in the brain . The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances . They send these signals by means of an axon , which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects , usually with numerous branches , to other areas , sometimes nearby , sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body . The length of an axon can be extraordinary : for example , if a pyramidal cell , ( an excitatory neuron ) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body , its axon , equally magnified , would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter , extending more than a kilometer . These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials , which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1\u2013100 meters per second . Some neurons emit action potentials constantly , at rates of 10\u2013100 per second , usually in irregular patterns ; other neurons are quiet most of the time , but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 32], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [32, 69], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [69, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [84, 104], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [104, 151], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [151, 214], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [214, 250], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [250, 287], "label": "0"}]}

Thus , with such limited acceptance of his position as Great Khan , Kublai Khan increasingly became identified with China and sought support as Emperor of China .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 54], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [54, 94], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [94, 137], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [137, 188], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [188, 216], "label": "0"}]}

After the turmoil of the English Civil War , the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability .

The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan .

Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society , and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of `` man 's place in the universe '' . In the early 20th century , the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866 . Mendel 's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research . By 1953 , James D. Watson , Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA , the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms . In the late 20th century , the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time , and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome ( the Human Genome Project ) .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 54], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [54, 78], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [78, 93], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [93, 131], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [131, 165], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [165, 191], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [191, 221], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [221, 261], "label": "0"}]}

Founded by Israel ben Eliezer , known as the Baal Shem Tov ( 1698\u20131760 ) , it emerged in an age of persecution of the Jewish people , when a schism existed between scholarly and common European Jews . In addition to bridging this class gap , Hasidic teachings sought to reintroduce joy in the performance of the commandments and in prayer through the popularisation of Jewish mysticism ( this joy had been suppressed in the intense intellectual study of the Talmud ) . The Ba'al Shem Tov sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance . In a practical sense , what distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from other forms of Haredi Judaism is the close-knit organization of Hasidic communities centered on a Rebbe ( sometimes translated as `` Grand Rabbi '' ) , and various customs and modes of dress particular to each community . In some cases , there are religious ideological distinctions between Hasidic groups , as well . Another phenomenon that sets Hasidic Judaism apart from general Haredi Judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking Yiddish ; in ( many ) Hasidic households and communities , Yiddish is spoken exclusively .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 33], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [33, 46], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [46, 65], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [65, 104], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [104, 149], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [149, 164], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [164, 212], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [212, 228], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [228, 262], "label": "0"}]}

A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware , after which work began on programming tools . Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time , no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch . Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time .
