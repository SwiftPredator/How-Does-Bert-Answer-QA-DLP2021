The key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current . This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents , intended to be carried by the earthed ( grounded ) running rail , flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead . This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together . The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains . Some of these , particularly Victorian mains that predated London 's underground railways , were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments . The four-rail system solves the problem . Although the supply has an artificially created earth point , this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels . Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak , but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains . However , elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 25], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [25, 58], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [58, 76], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [76, 101], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [101, 131], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [131, 138], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [138, 167], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [167, 206], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [206, 243], "label": "0"}]}

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment , including Deism and talk of atheism . Deism , according to Thomas Paine , is the simple belief in God the Creator , with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source . Instead , the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time . Atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents . Wilson and Reill note that , `` In fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of Christianity , were true atheists . Rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . '' Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men . Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined . That is , since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society . Bayle ( 1647\u20131706 ) observed that in his day , `` prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] . `` . He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society . Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law , the result would be moral anarchy : every individual `` could have no law but his own will , no end but himself . He would be a god to himself , and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 31], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [31, 59], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [59, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [84, 95], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [95, 123], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [123, 146], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [146, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [160, 183], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [183, 215], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [215, 240], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [240, 263], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [263, 300], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [300, 326], "label": "0"}]}

In this view , phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another ; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific . Rather than acting on segments , phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups . Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance . Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously ( though the output of one process may be the input to another ) . The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan ( Stampe 's wife ) ; there are many natural phonologists in Europe , and a few in the U.S. , such as Geoffrey Nathan .

The most reliable method for assessing pain in most humans is by asking a question : a person may report pain that can not be detected by any known physiological measure . However , like infants ( Latin infans meaning `` unable to speak '' ) , animals can not answer questions about whether they feel pain ; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans can not be applied to them . Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways . Ren\u00e9 Descartes for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do . Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University , the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals , writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain , and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain . In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians , he was regularly asked to `` prove '' that animals are conscious , and to provide `` scientifically acceptable '' grounds for claiming that they feel pain . Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view . Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal , noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support , some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined . The ability of invertebrate species of animals , such as insects , to feel pain and suffering is also unclear .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [14, 46], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [46, 87], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [87, 101], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [101, 125], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [125, 178], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [178, 215], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [215, 231], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [231, 273], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [273, 294], "label": "0"}]}

Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices . Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation . The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding , cold welding , vacuum packing and vacuum frying . Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates , as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time ( on the order of minutes to days ) . High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air , allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination . This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition , physical vapor deposition , and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings , and to surface science . The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles .

Adolescence marks a rapid change in one 's role within a family . Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully , but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence , when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals . The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents . When children go through puberty , there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond . Arguments often concern minor issues of control , such as curfew , acceptable clothing , and the adolescent 's right to privacy , which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority . Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another , new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents ' values . Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements . While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past , it has become a dangerous place for children . While adolescents strive for their freedoms , the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject , due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites . Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites in the first place and this further increases their mistrust . An important challenge for the parent\u2013adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks .

Until recently , in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition , the concept was thought to mean ( as a shorthand ) ' a division of sovereignty between two levels of government ' . New research , however , argues that this can not be correct , as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible . The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century , over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession , showed this . One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters , but not both simultaneously . Therefore , it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as ' a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government ' . What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established . This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms , where before only one was known , based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole ( in one people ) or in the parts ( in many peoples ) : the federal state ( or federation ) and the federal union of states ( or federal union ) , respectively .

In 1982 , Britain 's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands , acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire . Britain 's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing Falklands War was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain 's status as a world power . The same year , the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by patriating the Canadian constitution from Britain . The 1982 Canada Act passed by the British parliament ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution . Similarly , the Constitution Act 1986 reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain , and the Australia Act 1986 severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states .

Hasidic or Chasidic Judaism overlaps significantly with Haredi Judaism in its engagement with the secular and commercial world , and in regard to social issues . It precedes the later and differs in its genesis and emerged focus . The movement originated in Eastern Europe ( what is now Belarus and Ukraine ) in the 18th century . Founded by Israel ben Eliezer , known as the Baal Shem Tov ( 1698\u20131760 ) , it emerged in an age of persecution of the Jewish people , when a schism existed between scholarly and common European Jews . In addition to bridging this class gap , Hasidic teachings sought to reintroduce joy in the performance of the commandments and in prayer through the popularisation of Jewish mysticism ( this joy had been suppressed in the intense intellectual study of the Talmud ) . The Ba'al Shem Tov sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance . In a practical sense , what distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from other forms of Haredi Judaism is the close-knit organization of Hasidic communities centered on a Rebbe ( sometimes translated as `` Grand Rabbi '' ) , and various customs and modes of dress particular to each community . In some cases , there are religious ideological distinctions between Hasidic groups , as well . Another phenomenon that sets Hasidic Judaism apart from general Haredi Judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking Yiddish ; in ( many ) Hasidic households and communities , Yiddish is spoken exclusively .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [11, 37], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [37, 50], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [50, 69], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [69, 108], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [108, 153], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [153, 168], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [168, 216], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [216, 232], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [232, 266], "label": "0"}]}

Owen 's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley , Hooker and Darwin , but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous `` ordained becoming '' , with new species appearing by natural birth . Others that rejected natural selection , but supported `` creation by birth '' , included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design . Since 1858 , Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans , contesting Owen 's view that humans were a separate sub-class . Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate . In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the `` Great Hippocampus Question '' and parodied in The Water-Babies as the `` great hippopotamus test '' , Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains . Others , including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace , thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes , but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process .

Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design , greener roof designs , biodegradable materials , and more attention to a structure 's energy usage . This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment . Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright , in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand . There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles . Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques . The U.S. Green Building Council 's LEED ( Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) rating system has been instrumental in this .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 25], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [25, 57], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [57, 87], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [87, 104], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [104, 150], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [150, 170], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [170, 191], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [191, 214], "label": "0"}]}

While the format was not widely adopted by North American consumers , it was well received among videophiles due to the superior audio and video quality compared to VHS and Betamax tapes , finding a place in nearly one million American homes by the end of 1990 . The format was more popular in Japan than in North America because prices were kept low to ensure adoption , resulting in minimal price differences between VHS tapes and the higher quality LaserDiscs , helping ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in Japan . Anime collectors in every country the LD format was released , which includes both North America and Japan , also quickly became familiar with this format , and sought the higher video and sound quality of LaserDisc and the availability of numerous titles not available on VHS .

Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria . The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses , more specifically , bacteriophages . Bacteriophages , also known simply as phages , are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles . By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium , phages destroy their metabolism , which eventually results in the cell 's death . Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium , allowing their DNA to be transcribed . Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released , the cell will lyse . One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect `` good '' bacteria , or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings . However , studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria , which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 27], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [27, 49], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [49, 71], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [71, 93], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [93, 109], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [109, 138], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [138, 173], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [173, 205], "label": "0"}]}

The physical properties , such as density , reactivity , Young 's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements , but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials . This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy , because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms , and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors , helping the alloy resist deformation . Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present . For example , impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties , as first predicted by White , Hogan , Suhl , Tian Abrie and Nakamura . Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals . Bronze , an alloy of copper and tin , was the first alloy discovered , during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age ; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons , but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties .

Loring Brace , the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther , and the geneticist Joseph Graves , [ page needed ] have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as `` continental races '' , this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations . The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled . When one samples continental groups , the clusters become continental ; if one had chosen other sampling patterns , the clustering would be different . Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders , Mayans and Maoris , three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori , Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials . Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that , seen in this way , both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments . They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies , this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species , because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions . Moreover , the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions ( i.e. , splitters ) or a continuum ( i.e. , lumpers ) . Under Kaplan and Winther 's view , racial groupings are objective social constructions ( see Mills 1998 ) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons . In earlier work , Winther had identified `` diversity partitioning '' and `` clustering analysis '' as two separate methodologies , with distinct questions , assumptions , and protocols .

A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment , including Deism and talk of atheism . Deism , according to Thomas Paine , is the simple belief in God the Creator , with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source . Instead , the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time . Atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents . Wilson and Reill note that , `` In fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of Christianity , were true atheists . Rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . '' Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men . Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined . That is , since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society . Bayle ( 1647\u20131706 ) observed that in his day , `` prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] . `` . He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society . Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law , the result would be moral anarchy : every individual `` could have no law but his own will , no end but himself . He would be a god to himself , and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [21, 40], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [40, 68], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [68, 93], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [93, 104], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [104, 132], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [132, 155], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [155, 169], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [169, 192], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [192, 224], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [224, 249], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [249, 272], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [272, 309], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 21], "span2": [309, 335], "label": "0"}]}

Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( `` wand '' ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) .

Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body ( e.g . muscles , skin , and hair ) . They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body . Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids , which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur ( these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein , such as the keratin in hair ) . The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins ( protein retention ) and to replace damaged proteins ( maintenance ) . As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision , amino acids must be present in the diet . Excess amino acids are discarded , typically in the urine . For all animals , some amino acids are essential ( an animal can not produce them internally ) and some are non-essential ( the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds ) . About twenty amino acids are found in the human body , and about ten of these are essential and , therefore , must be included in the diet . A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids ( especially those that are essential ) is particularly important in some situations : during early development and maturation , pregnancy , lactation , or injury ( a burn , for instance ) . A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids ; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [9, 22], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [22, 30], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [30, 43], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [43, 83], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [83, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [105, 125], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [125, 136], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [136, 170], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [170, 199], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [199, 242], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 9], "span2": [242, 267], "label": "0"}]}

The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory , as well as voluntary programs , affirmed the civil rights of people of color . Furthermore , these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination . In 1961 , President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term `` affirmative action '' in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors `` take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed , and employees are treated during employment , without regard to their race , creed , color , or national origin .

Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift ( B. scabrinota , T. californica ) . In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis , a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze .

Light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year ; for instance , on average , less than 1.6 in ( 41 mm ) of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is rare . On occasion , Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events . One such event occurred on December 2\u20134 , 2007 , when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon . Precipitation totals exceeded 13.8 in ( 350 mm ) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h ( 130 mph ) along coastal Oregon . It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 130 mm ( 5.1 in ) of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period . Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [12, 42], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [42, 74], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [74, 118], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [118, 129], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [129, 170], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [170, 197], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [197, 226], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 12], "span2": [226, 243], "label": "0"}]}

They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan . They enlarged history by using the methods of social history . It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously .

This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb , the grandson of Umayya , to Muhammad and to Islam . Abu Sufyan sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr . He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr . The Battle of Uhud is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims , as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans .

While quite different works , Locke , Hobbes , and Rousseau agreed that a social contract , in which the government 's authority lies in the consent of the governed , is necessary for man to live in civil society . Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law ; in which all men are born equal and with the right to life , liberty and property . However , when one citizen breaks the Law of Nature , both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war , from which it is virtually impossible to break free . Therefore , Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an `` unbiased judge '' or common authority , such as courts , to appeal to . Contrastingly , Rousseau 's conception relies on the supposition that `` civil man '' is corrupted , while `` natural man '' has no want he can not fulfill himself . Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established . Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom .

Statistically speaking , cable-borne elevators are extremely safe . Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system . In 1998 , it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent ( 1 in 12 million ) of elevator rides result in an anomaly , and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open . Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year , most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example , technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts , and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents , such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors . In fact , prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks , the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog , severing the cables of an elevator cab , which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building , seriously injuring ( though not killing ) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator . However , there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children 's hospital , where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged . This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point , and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping ( or , in this case , a free-fall ) . While it is possible ( though extraordinarily unlikely ) for an elevator 's cable to snap , all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing . An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 ( up to 12 or more in high rise installations ) hoist cables or belts , each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight . In addition , there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed ; if this happens , the device causes copper ( or silicon nitride in high rise installations ) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft , stopping the elevator quickly , but not so abruptly as to cause injury . This device is called the governor , and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis . In addition , a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination ( depending on the travel height and travel speed ) is installed at the bottom of the shaft ( or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft ) to somewhat cushion any impact . However , In Thailand , in November 2012 , a woman was killed in free falling elevator , in what was reported as the `` first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [22, 31], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [31, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [42, 86], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [86, 154], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [154, 229], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [229, 258], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [258, 300], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [300, 340], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [340, 388], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [388, 453], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [453, 468], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [468, 528], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [528, 564], "label": "0"}]}

Under Edward VI , the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I ; even so two radicals were executed in Edward 's reign ( one for denying the reality of the incarnation , the other for denying Christ 's divinity ) . Under Mary , around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction . When Elizabeth I came to the throne , the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of `` ... a subversive fifth column . '' The last execution of a `` heretic '' in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612 .

Romantic relationships tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence . By age 15 , 53 % of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months . In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 , 20 % of 14\u221217-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom . A 2002 American study found that those aged 15\u201344 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females . The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well . This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond ( e.g . caregiving , appropriate attachment ) , although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence . Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth . Overall , positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits . High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem , self-confidence , and social competence . For example , an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner , whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner . Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race , ethnicity , popularity , and physical attractiveness . However , there are traits in which certain individuals , particularly adolescent girls , seek diversity .
