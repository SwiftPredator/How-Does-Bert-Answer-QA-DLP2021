The book was widely translated in Darwin 's lifetime , but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors , and some translations were biased by the translator 's own agenda . Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany , hoping that suitable applicants would come forward , as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher . He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn , but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn 's own ideas , adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted . Bronn translated `` favoured races '' as `` perfected races '' , and added essays on issues including the origin of life , as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn 's adherence to Naturphilosophie . In 1862 , Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin 's suggested additions , but then died of a heart attack . Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus , who published an improved translation in 1867 . Darwin 's attempts to find a translator in France fell through , and the translation by Cl\u00e9mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin 's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics , as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed .

The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence . In 1955 , Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings , still based on the principle of the single microphone . The center ( single ) microphone was of paramount importance , with the two side mics adding depth and space .

In 1961 , Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording . The greater thickness and width of 35 mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response .
