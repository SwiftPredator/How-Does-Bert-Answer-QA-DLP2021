In 1824 , the French physicist Fran\u00e7ois Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields , termed Arago 's rotations , which , by manually turning switches on and off , Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor . In the 1880s , many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC 's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC . The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla , a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887 . In 1888 , the Royal Academy of Science of Turin published Ferraris ' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that `` the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor . '' In 1888 , Tesla presented his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types : one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor , another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor , and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding . One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887 , however , also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor . George Westinghouse promptly bought Tesla 's patents , employed Tesla to develop them , and assigned C. F. Scott to help Tesla , Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889 . The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride , Colorado in 1891 . Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development , Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890 . This type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications . However , he claimed that Tesla 's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations , which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work . Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893 , these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor . The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891 . By 1896 , General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design , later called the squirrel-cage rotor . Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower ( HP ) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 HP motor in 1897 .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 52], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [52, 84], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [84, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [119, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [161, 227], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [227, 245], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [245, 276], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [276, 309], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [309, 334], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [334, 349], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [349, 375], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [375, 419], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [419, 431], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [431, 453], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [453, 487], "label": "0"}]}

The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy , in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures .

A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic ( where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group ) , with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta . Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic , so rather than using ranks like subclass , superorder , and infraorder , it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings ( in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group ) .

The tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it . The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable , safe and enjoyable . These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of `` filtered permeability '' to the existing irregular network of streets . It means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and , selectively , `` filter out '' the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre . While certain streets are discontinuous for cars , they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre . In addition , these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip . This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the Fused Grid .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 30], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [30, 60], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [60, 81], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [81, 112], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [112, 136], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [136, 155], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [155, 181], "label": "0"}]}

Capacity building is an ongoing problem experienced by NPOs for a number of reasons . Most rely on external funding ( government funds , grants from charitable foundations , direct donations ) to maintain their operations and changes in these sources of revenue may influence the reliability or predictability with which the organization can hire and retain staff , sustain facilities , create programs , or maintain tax-exempt status . For example , a university that sells research to for-profit companies may have tax exemption problems . In addition , unreliable funding , long hours and low pay can result in employee retention problems . During 2009 , the US government acknowledged this critical need by the inclusion of the Nonprofit Capacity Building Program in the Serve America Act .
