Media Transfer Protocol ( MTP ) was designed by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device 's filesystem than USB mass storage , at the level of files rather than disk blocks . It also has optional DRM features . MTP was designed for use with portable media players , but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 ( Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP ) . The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does , alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer . The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 41], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [41, 48], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [48, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [105, 145], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [145, 162], "label": "0"}]}

For air dielectric capacitors the breakdown field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m ; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m ; for oil , 15 to 25 MV/m ; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric . The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited . Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV . As the voltage increases , the dielectric must be thicker , making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages . The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts ; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown . Once this starts to happen , the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate , leaving carbon behind and causing a short ( or relatively low resistance ) circuit . The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [22, 71], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [71, 89], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [89, 107], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [107, 131], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [131, 169], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [169, 204], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 22], "span2": [204, 226], "label": "0"}]}

In the United States , political commentators often refer to the `` red states '' , which traditionally vote for Republican candidates in presidential elections , and `` blue states '' , which vote for the Democratic candidate .

In Australia , nonprofit organisations include trade unions , charitable entities , co-operatives , universities and hospitals , mutual societies , grass-root and support groups , political parties , religious groups , incorporated associations , not-for-profit companies , trusts and more . Furthermore , they operate across a multitude of domains and industries , from health , employment , disability and other human services to local sporting clubs , credit unions and research institutes . A nonprofit organisation in Australia can choose from a number of legal forms depending on the needs and activities of the organisation : co-operative , company limited by guarantee , unincorporated association , incorporated association ( by the Associations Incorporation Act 1985 ) or incorporated association or council ( by the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 ) . From an academic perspective , social enterprise is for the most part considered a sub-set of the nonprofit sector as typically they too are concerned with a purpose relating to a public good , however these are not bound to adhere to a nonprofit legal structure and many incorporate and operate as for-profit entities .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 52], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [52, 85], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [85, 145], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [145, 200], "label": "1"}]}

The rediscovery of Aristotle 's works\u2013more than 3000 pages of it would eventually be translated \u2013fuelled a spirit of inquiry into natural processes that had already begun to emerge in the 12th century . Some scholars believe that these works represented one of the most important document discoveries in Western intellectual history . Richard Dales , for instance , calls the discovery of Aristotle 's works `` a turning point in the history of Western thought . '' After Aristotle re-emerged , a community of scholars , primarily communicating in Latin , accelerated the process and practice of attempting to reconcile the thoughts of Greek antiquity , and especially ideas related to understanding the natural world , with those of the church . The efforts of this `` scholasticism '' were focused on applying Aristotelian logic and thoughts about natural processes to biblical passages and attempting to prove the viability of those passages through reason .

Many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries . Pigments , in this case , are minerals which reflect the color green , rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities . The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all . Among the more notable green minerals , however is the emerald , which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium . Chromium ( III ) oxide ( Cr2O3 ) , is called chrome green , also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment . For many years , the source of amazonite 's color was a mystery . Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors , the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar .
