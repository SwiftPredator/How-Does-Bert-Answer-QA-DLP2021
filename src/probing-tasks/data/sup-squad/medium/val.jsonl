Although pest insects attract the most attention , many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans . Some insects , like wasps , bees , butterflies and ants , pollinate flowering plants . Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects . As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species , they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed . This greatly increases plants ' ability to cross-pollinate , which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness . This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture . As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants . This helps to spread the plants which increases plant diversity . This leads to an overall better environment . A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects , and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field , orchard or greenhouse at bloom time . :240\u2013243 Another solution , as shown in Delaware , has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki .

The space-consuming analog video signal of a LaserDisc limited playback duration to 30 minutes ( CAV ) or 60 minutes ( CLV ) per side because of the hardware manufacturer 's refusal to reduce line count for increased playtime . After one side was finished playing , a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching a movie , and some titles fill two or more discs . Many players , especially units built after the mid-1980s , can `` flip '' discs automatically by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc , but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change . If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc , manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film . One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD-W1 , which features two disc platters . In addition , perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs , which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side . In later years , Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer , which `` grabbed '' a single frame from a CLV disc .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 53], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [53, 84], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [84, 128], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [128, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [161, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [177, 213], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [213, 243], "label": "0"}]}

Unlike the phonautograph , it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound . Despite the similarity of name , there is no documentary evidence that Edison 's phonograph was based on Scott 's phonautograph . Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape , with the idea of creating a `` telephone repeater '' analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on . Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced , his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later . The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated . The recording could be played back immediately . The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey , Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but , importantly , not reproducing sound . Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats . Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned , but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations , the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use . A decade later , Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet . This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device . The wax phonograph cylinder created the recorded sound market at the end of the 1880s and dominated it through the early years of the 20th century .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 19], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [19, 33], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [33, 55], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [55, 87], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [87, 130], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [130, 152], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [152, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [160, 196], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [196, 210], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [210, 247], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [247, 269], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [269, 284], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [284, 311], "label": "0"}]}

The vast Seleucid Empire was , like Egypt , mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite . The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece . These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch , the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis , Seleucia ( north of Babylon ) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates . These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies , councils and elected magistrates , but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials . Apart from these cities , there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons ( choria ) , military colonies ( katoikiai ) and Greek villages ( komai ) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule . This 'Greco-Macedonian ' population ( which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women ) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men ( out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000 ) during the reign of Antiochos III . The rest of the army was made up of native troops . Antiochus III the great conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of Seleucus I . After being defeated by Ptolemy IV 's forces at Raphia ( 217 ) , Antiochus III led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces ( 212-205 ) including Bactria , Parthia , Ariana , Sogdiana , Gedrosia and Drangiana . He was successful , bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers . After the death of Ptolemy IV ( 204 ) , Antiochus took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to conquer Coele-Syria in the fifth Syrian war ( 202-195 ) . He then began expanding his influence into Pergamene territory in Asia and crossed into Europe , fortifying Lysimachia on the hellespont , but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia ( 190 BCE ) . In the Treaty of Apamea which ended the war , Antiochus lost all of his territories in Anatolia west of the Taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 24], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [24, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [42, 72], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [72, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [105, 146], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [146, 189], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [189, 201], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [201, 225], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [225, 271], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [271, 293], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [293, 323], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [323, 369], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [369, 403], "label": "0"}]}

This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location ( for example , traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings ) . Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off .

The objective is to minimize the cost of light , not the cost of lamps . Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours , but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours .
