Although pest insects attract the most attention , many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans . Some insects , like wasps , bees , butterflies and ants , pollinate flowering plants . Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects . As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species , they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed . This greatly increases plants ' ability to cross-pollinate , which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness . This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture . As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants . This helps to spread the plants which increases plant diversity . This leads to an overall better environment . A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects , and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field , orchard or greenhouse at bloom time . :240\u2013243 Another solution , as shown in Delaware , has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki .

After one side was finished playing , a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching a movie , and some titles fill two or more discs . Many players , especially units built after the mid-1980s , can `` flip '' discs automatically by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc , but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change . If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc , manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film . One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD-W1 , which features two disc platters . In addition , perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs , which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side . In later years , Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer , which `` grabbed '' a single frame from a CLV disc .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 53], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [53, 84], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [84, 128], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [128, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [161, 177], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [177, 213], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [213, 243], "label": "0"}]}

Unlike the phonautograph , it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound . Despite the similarity of name , there is no documentary evidence that Edison 's phonograph was based on Scott 's phonautograph . Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape , with the idea of creating a `` telephone repeater '' analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on . Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced , his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later . The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated . The recording could be played back immediately . The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey , Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but , importantly , not reproducing sound . Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats . Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned , but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations , the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use .

The vast Seleucid Empire was , like Egypt , mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite . The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece . These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch , the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis , Seleucia ( north of Babylon ) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates . These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies , councils and elected magistrates , but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials . Apart from these cities , there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons ( choria ) , military colonies ( katoikiai ) and Greek villages ( komai ) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule . This 'Greco-Macedonian ' population ( which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women ) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men ( out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000 ) during the reign of Antiochos III . The rest of the army was made up of native troops . Antiochus III the great conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of Seleucus I . After being defeated by Ptolemy IV 's forces at Raphia ( 217 ) , Antiochus III led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces ( 212-205 ) including Bactria , Parthia , Ariana , Sogdiana , Gedrosia and Drangiana . He was successful , bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers . After the death of Ptolemy IV ( 204 ) , Antiochus took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to conquer Coele-Syria in the fifth Syrian war ( 202-195 ) . He then began expanding his influence into Pergamene territory in Asia and crossed into Europe , fortifying Lysimachia on the hellespont , but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia ( 190 BCE ) . In the Treaty of Apamea which ended the war , Antiochus lost all of his territories in Anatolia west of the Taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [7, 24], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [24, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [42, 72], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [72, 105], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [105, 146], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [146, 189], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [189, 201], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [201, 225], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [225, 271], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [271, 293], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [293, 323], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [323, 369], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 7], "span2": [369, 403], "label": "0"}]}

Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots . Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva . He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there . Despite heavy persecution , the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment . French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s . This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts , known as the French Wars of Religion . The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559 . Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time , illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France . The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions . Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion once again .

Classification seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities . Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure , cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components , such as DNA , fatty acids , pigments , antigens and quinones . While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains , it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species . This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria , as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species . Due to lateral gene transfer , some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms . To overcome this uncertainty , modern bacterial classification emphasizes molecular systematics , using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination , genome-genome hybridization , as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer , such as the rRNA gene . Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology , and Bergey 's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology .

His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive .

This process , known as the maternal immunization hypothesis ( MIH ) , would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother 's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth .

The parapodia ( `` limbs '' ) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips \u2013 for example jointed , comb-like or hooked . Chetae are made of moderately flexible \u03b2-chitin and are formed by follicles , each of which has a chetoblast ( `` hair-forming '' ) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta . The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli , fine hair-like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta . When the cheta is complete , the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast , leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta . Hence annelids ' chetae are structurally different from the setae ( `` bristles '' ) of arthropods , which are made of the more rigid \u03b1-chitin , have a single internal cavity , and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [4, 25], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [25, 45], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [45, 74], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [74, 112], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [112, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [133, 159], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 4], "span2": [159, 205], "label": "0"}]}

The exact causes and motivations for Rome 's military conflicts and expansions during the republic are subject to wide debate .

In its early history , as Rome successfully defended itself against foreign threats in central and then northern Italy , neighboring city-states sought the protection a Roman alliance would bring . As such , early republican Rome was not an `` empire '' or `` state '' in the modern sense , but an alliance of independent city-states ( similar to the Greek hegemonies of the same period ) with varying degrees of genuine independence ( which itself changed over time ) engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection , but led by Rome . With some important exceptions , successful wars in early republican Rome generally led not to annexation or military occupation , but to the restoration of the way things were .

In 1939 , Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery .

While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource , the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture .

These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm . Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south , but over time , sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight . In 1699 , Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun .

Ritter 's Oxford Manual of Style ( 2002 ) suggests capitalising `` the first word and all nouns , pronouns , adjectives , verbs and adverbs , but generally not articles , conjunctions and short prepositions '' . This is an old form of emphasis , similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles .

Throughout the history of the South Slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . Chakavian , Kajkavian , Shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . Prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called `` Illyric '' , `` Slavic '' , `` Slavonian '' , `` Bosnian '' , `` Dalmatian '' , `` Serbian '' or `` Croatian '' . As such , the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824 , popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . At that time , Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires . Officially , the language was called variously Serbo-Croat , Croato-Serbian , Serbian and Croatian , Croatian and Serbian , Serbian or Croatian , Croatian or Serbian . Unofficially , Serbs and Croats typically called the language `` Serbian '' or `` Croatian '' , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina , `` Bosnian '' , `` Croatian '' , and `` Serbian '' were considered to be three names of a single official language . Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozovi\u0107 advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European , Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( \u2018 Bosnian \u2019 and \u2018 Montenegrin \u2019 ) .

In the wake of the Coventry Blitz , there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters . Many Londoners , in particular , took to using the Underground railway system , without authority , for shelter and sleeping through the night there until the following morning . So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London , that the Police were sent in to seize their production facilities . The Government , up until November 1940 , was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter . Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards , in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying Neville Chamberlain resigned . Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made . He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling . Still , many British citizens , who had been members of the Labour Party , itself inert over the issue , turned to the Communist Party . The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners , big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace . Though they failed to make a large gain in influence , the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941 . The `` Communist threat '' was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order , with the support of the Cabinet , the stoppage of the Daily Worker and The Week ; the Communist newspaper and journal .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 36], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [36, 66], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [66, 101], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [101, 118], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [118, 144], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [144, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [161, 185], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [185, 212], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [212, 243], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [243, 265], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [265, 303], "label": "0"}]}

His use , and that of many writers after him `` refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism , and through artifice , become fully human '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [17, 78], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [78, 105], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 17], "span2": [105, 139], "label": "0"}]}

{"info": {"doc_id": "squad_sup_facts", "q_id": "572ed638dfa6aa1500f8d430"}, "text": "In the late nineties , what was considered the rate of cable-borne elevator problems ? Statistically speaking , cable-borne elevators are extremely safe . Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system . In 1998 , it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent ( 1 in 12 million ) of elevator rides result in an anomaly , and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open . Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year , most of them are maintenance-related \u2014 for example , technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts , and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents , such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors . In fact , prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks , the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog , severing the cables of an elevator cab , which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building , seriously injuring ( though not killing ) the sole occupant \u2014 the elevator operator . However , there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children 's hospital , where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged . This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point , and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping ( or , in this case , a free-fall ) . While it is possible ( though extraordinarily unlikely ) for an elevator 's cable to snap , all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing . An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 ( up to 12 or more in high rise installations ) hoist cables or belts , each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight . In addition , there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed ; if this happens , the device causes copper ( or silicon nitride in high rise installations ) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft , stopping the elevator quickly , but not so abruptly as to cause injury .

Deism , according to Thomas Paine , is the simple belief in God the Creator , with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source . Instead , the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed , which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time . Atheism was much discussed , but there were few proponents . Wilson and Reill note that , `` In fact , very few enlightened intellectuals , even when they were vocal critics of Christianity , were true atheists . Rather , they were critics of orthodox belief , wedded rather to skepticism , deism , vitalism , or perhaps pantheism . '' Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men . Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil , the moral order of society was undermined . That is , since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law , and had no fear of eternal consequences , they were far more likely to disrupt society . Bayle ( 1647\u20131706 ) observed that in his day , `` prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [ religion ] . `` . He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society .

Hydrostatic gauges ( such as the mercury column manometer ) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures . The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube . The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube , one side of which is connected to the region of interest . Any fluid can be used , but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure . Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr ( 100 Pa ) to above atmospheric . An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column . The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10\u22126 torr ( 0.1 mPa ) , which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology . Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures , but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties .

By the end of the 1930s vinyl 's advantages of light weight , relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications . When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records , however , the much higher cost of the raw material , as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players , made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time . During the Second World War , the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas . After the war , the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated . In late 1945 , RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s , at a de luxe price . Later , Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s , while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite , Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex , but these were mainly used to produce `` unbreakable '' children 's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 30], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [30, 65], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [65, 118], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [118, 144], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [144, 178], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [178, 204], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [204, 256], "label": "1"}]}

Kennedy International Airport in New York , Link Light Rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport , and the Silver Line T at Boston 's Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) . Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion . Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways ( 'freeways ' or 'motorways ' ) from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [14, 51], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [51, 76], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [76, 132], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [132, 145], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [145, 175], "label": "0"}]}

Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics , aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name , ( see Aether ( mythology ) ) . Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated . Additionally , the concept informed Isaac Newton 's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat . 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth 's orbit . While the Earth does , in fact , move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space , the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected . In 1912 , astronomer Henry Pickering commented : `` While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether , [ it ] is characteristic of a gas , and free gaseous molecules are certainly there '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [10, 42], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [42, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [75, 91], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [91, 108], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [108, 127], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [127, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 10], "span2": [161, 199], "label": "0"}]}

Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . To the King 's annoyance , Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive . Victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . She objected on the grounds of the King 's disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced Victoria to continue the tours . At Ramsgate in October 1835 , Victoria contracted a severe fever , which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence . While Victoria was ill , Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary . As a teenager , Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff . Once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother 's household .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [14, 47], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [47, 67], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [67, 83], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [83, 106], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [106, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [133, 163], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [163, 184], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [184, 203], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [203, 223], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 14], "span2": [223, 242], "label": "0"}]}

In biology , energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism . Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism . Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates ( including sugars ) , lipids , and proteins , which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration . In human terms , the human equivalent ( H-e ) ( Human energy conversion ) indicates , for a given amount of energy expenditure , the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism , assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts . For example , if our bodies run ( on average ) at 80 watts , then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents ( 100 \u00f7 80 ) i.e . 1.25 H-e.

Different phases of digestion take place including : the cephalic phase , gastric phase , and intestinal phase . The cephalic phase occurs at the sight , thought and smell of food , which stimulate the cerebral cortex . Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata . After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine . Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40 % of maximum rate . Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal ( secretes acid ) and G cell ( secretes gastrin ) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin . The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours . It is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH . Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes . This activates the release of acetylcholine , which stimulates the release of more gastric juices . As protein enters the stomach , it binds to hydrogen ions , which raises the pH of the stomach . Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted . This triggers G cells to release gastrin , which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid . Gastric acid is about 0.5 % hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3 . Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine . The intestinal phase has two parts , the excitatory and the inhibitory . Partially digested food fills the duodenum . This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released .

Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium ( such as missile guidance and telemetry systems ) and in high-speed computers , where short traces were important . In cordwood construction , axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes . The components were either soldered together with jumper wire , or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads . To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers , thin insulating cards were placed between them . Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer . One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made . Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage ( as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program ) . Additionally , components located in the interior are difficult to replace . Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method ( as pictured ) , allowing the use of normal-leaded components .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [15, 56], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [56, 69], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [69, 99], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [99, 115], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [115, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [133, 156], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [156, 192], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [192, 204], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [204, 229], "label": "0"}]}

Peirce 's approach `` presupposes that ( 1 ) the objects of knowledge are real things , ( 2 ) the characters ( properties ) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them , and ( 3 ) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them . According to Peirce 's doctrine of fallibilism , the conclusions of science are always tentative .

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin 's Op . 10 \u00c9tudes , and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller , `` I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies . '' However , Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments , at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all , forcing an apology . Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other , although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as `` my friend Liszt '' . Some commentators point to events in the two men 's romantic lives which led to a rift between them ; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult 's obsession with Chopin , while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt 's growing relationship with George Sand .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [8, 33], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [33, 75], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [75, 84], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [84, 116], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [116, 161], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [161, 200], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 8], "span2": [200, 255], "label": "0"}]}

Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans . In 337 BC , the first plebeian praetor was elected . During these years , the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close . The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals . To win over the tribunes , the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate . As the tribunes and the senators grew closer , plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families . In time , the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [18, 41], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [41, 78], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [78, 95], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [95, 106], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [106, 119], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [119, 133], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [133, 160], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [160, 185], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 18], "span2": [185, 198], "label": "0"}]}

Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard\u2014Anjou , Normandy and England\u2014and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany . Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine , who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France , in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France . The result was the Angevin Empire , named after Henry 's paternal title as Count of Anjou and , more specifically , its seat in Angers . [ nb 2 ] The Empire , however , was inherently fragile : although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry , the disparate parts each had their own histories , traditions and governance structures . As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine , the extent of Henry 's power in the provinces diminished considerably , scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all . Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time . It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry 's death . Although the custom of primogeniture , under which an eldest son would inherit all his father 's lands , was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe , it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England . Most believed that Henry would divide the empire , giving each son a substantial portion , and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death . To complicate matters , much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet . Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France , making the feudal relationship even more challenging .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [5, 22], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [22, 42], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [42, 83], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [83, 110], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [110, 146], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [146, 178], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [178, 199], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [199, 213], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [213, 251], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [251, 283], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [283, 315], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 5], "span2": [315, 336], "label": "0"}]}

Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans .

Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight . The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate . Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes , or extensions from the insect 's exoskeleton called the nota , called the paranotal theory . Other theories are based on a pleural origin . These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills , spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa . The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites , a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa . In the Carboniferous age , some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm ( 20 in ) wide wingspan . The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen . The respiratory system of insects constrains their size , however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes .

For the start of the Roman Saturnalia , on December 17 authorities chose an enemy of the Roman people to represent the Lord of Misrule in each community . These men and women were forced to indulge in food and physical pleasures throughout the week , horribly murdered on December 25th : `` destroying the forces of darkness '' .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [15, 38], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [38, 56], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [56, 73], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [73, 102], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 15], "span2": [102, 133], "label": "1"}]}

In 1896 , Patrick and Gilbert observed that during a prolonged period of sleep deprivation , sleepiness increases and decreases with a period of approximately 24 hours . In 1918 , J.S . Szymanski showed that animals are capable of maintaining 24-hour activity patterns in the absence of external cues such as light and changes in temperature . In the early 20th century , circadian rhythms were noticed in the rhythmic feeding times of bees . Extensive experiments were done by Auguste Forel , Ingeborg Beling , and Oskar Wahl to see whether this rhythm was due to an endogenous clock . [ citation needed ] Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer isolated the first clock mutant in Drosophila in the early 1970s and mapped the `` period '' gene , the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioral rhythmicity . Joseph Takahashi discovered the first mammalian circadian clock mutation ( clock\u039419 ) using mice in 1994 . However , recent studies show that deletion of clock does not lead to a behavioral phenotype ( the animals still have normal circadian rhythms ) , which questions its importance in rhythm generation .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [13, 41], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [41, 46], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [46, 71], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [71, 89], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [89, 115], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [115, 152], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [152, 169], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 13], "span2": [169, 203], "label": "0"}]}

Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally .

It had gone through many , often public , ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'\u00e9tat by the latter pair .

Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world ( Ratcliffe , 2007 ) . James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies ' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic . He argues that transnational police information circuits help to `` compose the panic scenes of the security-control society '' .

Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species , most of European origin , and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds . Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna , feral pigeon , brown rat , European wasp , common starling and red fox . Many outlying suburbs , particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east , have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland . The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off . Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne , including the Mornington Peninsula National Park , Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east , Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east . There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne . Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils .

Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder , which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself ( in fact , that powder was an oxide of uranium ) .

On March 18 , 1965 , about a week before the first American piloted Project Gemini space flight , the USSR accelerated the competition , by launching the two-cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov . Voskhod 2 's design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , also known as a spacewalk , while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsule 's electronics would n't overheat . Leonov performed the first-ever EVA as part of the mission . A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov 's spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space , preventing him from re-entering the airlock . In order to overcome this , he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level . He succeeded in safely re-entering the ship , but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft 's atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 % pure oxygen , which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry . The reentry involved two more challenges : an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers ( 240 mi ) off its designated target area , the town of Perm ; and the instrument compartment 's failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry .", "targets": [{"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [11, 50], "label": "1"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [50, 92], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [92, 103], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [103, 126], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [126, 145], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [145, 186], "label": "0"}, {"span1": [0, 11], "span2": [186, 242], "label": "0"}]}

Once elected , a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine , which offered him lifetime influence , privilege and immunity . Therefore , civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family . Religious law was collegial and traditional ; it informed political decisions , could overturn them , and was difficult to exploit for personal gain . Priesthood was a costly honour : in traditional Roman practice , a priest drew no stipend . Cult donations were the property of the deity , whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding \u2013 this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds . For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum , permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime 's service in military or political life , or preferably both : it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty . For a freedman or slave , promotion as one of the Compitalia seviri offered a high local profile , and opportunities in local politics ; and therefore business . During the Imperial era , priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office ; in effect , it was the first step in a provincial cursus honorum . In Rome , the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren , once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities , then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms . The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays , accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt .
